Spectro
=======

Creates a spectrogram suited for synchronized Full HD display.


Installation
------------

tl;dr::

  $ vf new spectro
  (spectro) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Audio files are parsed to PCM using ``audiotools``, FFT calculation is
provided by ``numpy`` and ``.png`` files are written with ``Pillow``.

Audiotools
==========

Since the initial creation of this project, a new incompatible library
called "audiotools" was added to PyPI. This is not the one we want.

We want the more interesting but long in the tooth library that's
listed in ``requirements.txt``.   Unfortunately, it doesn't easily build
on macOS anymore.  You will need Homebrew to install the following
for you:

* opus
* opusfile
* libvorbis
* mpg123
* lame
* wavpack

I also had to edit ``setup.py`` to force the paths of mp3lame and
opusfile::

  diff --git a/setup.py b/setup.py
  index 2f007592..d31c6548 100755

A terrible hack.

Oh, and to *really* recompile what you've got in your python-audio-library
checkout, do ``make clean && make`` there before ``pip install -e .``.


Usage
-----

In its most basic form, just do::

  $ vf activate spectro
  (spectro) $ spectro.py song.flac

This will generate a PNG file in the current working directory::

  $ ls *.png
  song.flac.png

More info::

  (.venv) $ spectro.py --help


Known issues
------------

Help with any of the following highly appreciated.

Speed
~~~~~

On my laptop generating a PNG takes 10 seconds per minute of input.

Stereo
~~~~~~

Currently the spectrogram only takes into account the first channel in
the stream (left channel for stereo input).

Ripples
~~~~~~~

The generated spectrogram for files of high sample rate with small step
sizes has large overlaps in generated FFTs. This causes visible
"ripples" around strong signals. Using a window function on input didn't
help and frankly I don't know how to get rid of those.
